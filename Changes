   cookie file syntax;

 + tagedit.dialog now informs on editing read-only files;
 = increased maximum number of symbols per tag field in batchtag.dialog;

 ! fixed a bug when trailing spaces were added to all tag fields displayed by UI::Dialog::Backend::CDialog::form(),
   thus sometimes resulting in tag erasure in batchtag.dialog;
 + Installation via Makefile;
 = some code optimization done;
 - handle id3v2 tags as well as id3v1;
 - try to fix a strange issue with UI::Dialog::Backend::CDialog::form() crashing on field value equal to "--" (wtf?!)
 - fix UI::Dialog::Backend::CDialog::form() to be able to use "home","end" and backspace buttons in dialogs;
 - fix UI::Dialog::Backend::CDialog::form() bug related to escaping of $
 - problems with $ in tags (this is a bug of Taglib 1.5);
