v0.41  (21 Oct 2011):
 ! fixed a bug when trailing spaces were added to all tag fields displayed by UI::Dialog::Backend::CDialog::form(),
   thus sometimes resulting in tag erasure in batchtag.dialog;
 + Installation via Makefile;
 = some code optimization done;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.40b (03 Oct 2011):
 + More formats support :  flac, ape, wav etc. The scripts now compose a shell for the Audio::TagLib module;
 = got rid of the dependencies on packages "id3v2", "mp3info", "vorbistools" and the Locale::Recode Perl module
   (but introduced a new dependency on Audio::TagLib module);
 = Some code enhancements - the scripts are now smaller and a bit faster.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.30a (12 Sep 2011):
 + added OGG Vorbis tags support via vorbistools;
 = everything rewritten in perl (got rid of clumsy bash & sed constructions, but an a dependency on perl modules
				 UI::Dialog and Locale::Recode appeared. );
 ! fixed a bug in batchtag which disallowed processing of single quotes in tag fields;
 ! fixed a bug in tag2fname which caused a %n in format string to output a 1-digit tracknumber instead of adding a 
    leading zero, when handling tracknum like 5/13 and vice versa;
 ! more improvements on handling the format variables logic in fname2tag;
 ! fixed a bug in tag2fname related to some errors when running recode, resulting in 
    "XX.Unknown Artist - Untitled.mp3.mp3" output;
 ! fixed a bug in tagedit which caused the dialog to show corrupt data in some tag fields;
 + tagedit and batchtag now show the length and bitrate of the mp3 file (via new dependency on package mp3info);
 ! fixed a small bug with tagedit sometimes displaying the full path to file instead of just the filename in the dialog info;
 ! more bugfixes on special symbols handling in tag2fname;
 ! fixed a bug with last symbol of all tag fields being stripped off by fname2tag if run with no "-c" option;
 + some not-so-important messages added to batchtag.dialog.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.23 (19 Mar 2011):
 - added homedir cookie file ~/.audiotagtools to remember last dialogs choices;
 - added a command-line option in fname2tag, tag2fname, tagedit.dialog and a dialog input field in batchtag.dialog
    and tag2fname.dialog for charset selection (not only cp1251);
 - path to current directory is now echoed in the backtitle, first selected file name displayed in the head 
    of each dialog window;
 - added help messages to all scripts;
 - fixed the "first space" bug in fname2tag which caused filenames such as "09 Grease Monkey.mp3" result in
    incorrect tag fields filling when used with -f "%n %t" option);
 - fixed a bug in tag2fname related to tracknumber field containing non-digit character
    (e.g., 13/15 instead of just 13);
 - fixed a bug in tag2fname, which caused a crash on files with "/" in tags;
 - fixed a bug in tagedit.dialog related to duplicate ID3v2 tag fields (TIT/TT etc);
 - fixed a bug in tagedit.dialog related to consequent spaces in filenames;
 - improved logic with handling format %d and %u variables in fname2tag;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.22 (08 Mar 2011) - Added fname2tag and batchtag.dialog scripts, fixed several bugs. All five scripts seem
		     to work!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.21 (06 Mar 2011) - Added script 'tagedit' for dialog-based tag editing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.2 (23 Feb 2011) - CP-1251 Russian tags support; %d option changed to %f - defines output filename format;
		     now handles both id3v1 and v2 tags (prefer v2 to v1); proper handling of all special
		     characters in filenames.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.1 (?? Feb 2011) - Can rename files using two fixed formats, uses id3tool to extract and update tags.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
 - do something with the "-u" option in tag2fname (does nothing currently);
 - batchtag.dialog and tag2fname.dialog shouldn't crash on incorrect .audiotagtools syntax;
 - tag2fname.dialog shouldn't start if the files don't exist (or should it??);
 - catch all error messages;
 - try to fix a strange issue with UI::Dialog::Backend::CDialog::form() crashing on field value equal to "--" (wtf?!)
 - expand to XDialog;
